## The Many Iterations of a ggplot
This markdown is compiled to show the graphical output of conceptualizing and building a ggplot one step at a time.  Many of the steps here are very small iterations, but that is pretty much how it is done; deciding on one small change at a time.

This example is drawn from data in from Zubrowâ€™s 1974 *Population Contact Climate New Mexican Pueblos*.  I enjoy this data set, so I have used it a few times.  So this overview [blog pots](https://matthewdharris.com/2016/03/19/visualizing-zubrow-ggplot2-cowplot/
) and [this post](https://matthewdharris.com/2016/08/12/ggplot2-step-by-step/
) that goes over the script here in detail.

The intention of this plot is to support an argument made by Zubrow that there was a 18th to 20th century population shift in Pueblo society based on cultural contact and climate change.  Of course it will take more that a single graphic to make this point, but a single graphic would go a long way to help a reader see it.  To that end, I first decided on a graphic that would be focused on the percent change from the date of the first data point at 1760.  I wanted to use percent change to scale the y axis a bit more evenly since some of Pueblos had total populations that dwarfed the smaller pueblos and decreased the visual impact of the trend. Further, period over period change was pretty variable and did not tell the story. Secondly, since there is a geographic component to this population shift, I need to arrange the Pueblo data groups geographically East to West.  Ideally this would be done a s single row, but there are too many sites for that to work.

#### Note about ggplot2 version
this relies on the development version of ggplot2 for the subtitle and caption text.  To install this version, first install the `devtools` package `install.packages("devtools")`, then install ggplot from github `devtools::install_github("hadley/ggplot2")`.  If you do not do this and have the CRAN version, everything should work except the subtitle and caption, and you will get a warning.
